1. Open your **terminal/cmd/iterm**.
2. Clone project `git clone <link-https>` with https or `git clone <link-ssh>` with SSH.
3. Then `cd /<clone-project>`.

5. Then, run `npm install` on your teminal.
6. Copy `.env.example`file to `.env` on the config folder. You can type `copy config/.env.example config/.env` if using command prompt Windows or `cp config/.env.example config/.env` if using terminal, Ubuntu.
7. Open `.env` file and change database name (`PORT`) to whatever you wamt.
8. Run `npm run dev` to start as development or run `npm run start` to start as production.
